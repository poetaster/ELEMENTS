# ELEMENTS
An arduino port of the Mutable Instruments Elements module

An example for the arduino ide  is in process. To get an idea for you to use it, for the tonetoys scarp can be found at  https://github.com/poetaster/arduinoMI/tree/main/ElementsEngineScarp 

Please note that the .cc files are doubled by .inc files. This is probably not needed but we're still trying to get all the ide edge cases and platforms ironed out.
